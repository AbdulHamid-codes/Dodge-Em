# Dodge-Em
This was a semster project for the 1st semster of my BS-Computer Science, where i remade the game Dodge 'Em. 
Dodge 'Em is a driving-themed maze game programmed by Carla Meninsky and published in 1980 by Atari, Inc. for the Atari VCS. 
The project is implemented in open GL and written entirely in C++.
